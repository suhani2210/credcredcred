# How Do We Score?
Our credit scoring system evaluates companies using a sophisticated blend of financial health metrics and market sentiment to provide you with a comprehensive creditworthiness assessment. Here's how it works in simple terms:

# What We Measure

## 1. Financial Health Indicators (90% of the score)

### Traditional Credit Risk Models (50% weight)
We use the renowned Altman Z-Score methodology, which has been successfully predicting corporate bankruptcies since the 1960s. This model examines five key financial ratios:

* Working Capital Efficiency: How well the company manages its short-term assets versus short-term debts

* Profitability Retention: How much profit the company has accumulated over time relative to its size

* Operating Performance: The company's ability to generate earnings from its core business operations

* Market Valuation: How the stock market values the company compared to its debts

* Sales Generation: How efficiently the company converts its assets into revenue

### Modern Bankruptcy Prediction (40% weight)
We incorporate the Ohlson O-Score, a more recent model that adds important factors like:

* Company Size: Larger companies typically have more stability and resources

* Debt Structure: The relationship between total debts and total assets

* Liquidity Position: The company's ability to meet immediate financial obligations

* Recent Performance Trends: Whether the company has been profitable in recent periods

## 2. Market Sentiment (10% of the score) 

### News and Market Perception
We analyze current news sentiment around the company because:

* Market perception can quickly impact a company's access to credit

* Negative news can signal emerging problems before they appear in financial statements

* Positive sentiment often correlates with better business prospects and creditworthiness

# Why These Weights?

Financial Health Takes Priority (90%)
We allocate 90% of the score to financial metrics because:

* Proven Track Record: These models have decades of research backing their effectiveness

* Objective Data: Financial statements provide concrete, audited information

* Predictive Power: Academic studies show these ratios are strong predictors of financial distress

## Balanced Approach Between Models
* Altman Z-Score (50%): This model has the longest track record and focuses on core operational health

* Ohlson O-Score (40%): This complements Altman by adding modern insights about company size and debt structure

## Sentiment as Enhancement (10%)
We keep sentiment at 10% because:

* Market Efficiency: Stock prices and news often reflect information not yet visible in quarterly reports

* Early Warning System: Sentiment can signal problems before they impact financial statements

* Balanced Perspective: Too much weight on sentiment could make scores overly volatile

## How We Handle Missing Data
Real-world financial data isn't always complete. When information is missing, we:

* Use Industry Standards: Apply typical ratios from similar companies

* Conservative Estimates: When in doubt, we err on the side of caution

* Cross-Verification: Use multiple data sources to fill gaps intelligently

# Score Interpretation
## Final Score Range: 0-100

* 80-100: Excellent credit risk (very low chance of default)

* 60-79: Good credit risk (low chance of default)

* 40-59: Moderate credit risk (some caution warranted)

* 20-39: High credit risk (significant caution needed)

* 0-19: Very high credit risk (avoid or require substantial protections)

## Dynamic Scoring Range
We provide not just a single score, but a range that reflects:

* Uncertainty in Data: Acknowledging that financial analysis involves some estimation

* Market Volatility: Sentiment can cause short-term fluctuations in creditworthiness

* Risk Assessment: Helping you understand both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios

* This multi-faceted approach ensures you get a well-rounded view of credit risk that combines time-tested financial analysis with modern market insights, giving you the confidence to make informed lending and investment decisions.
